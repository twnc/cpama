We discussed using the expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) to calculate the
number of elements in an array. The expression sizeof (a) / sizeof(t), where t
is the type of a's elements. would also work, but it's considered an inferior
technique. Why?

This is because you could modify the array's type later, and you wouldn't need
to remember to modify this piece of code. Say if you decided you need a larger
type and switched your array from an int array to a long array, sizeof(a) /
sizeof(a[0]) would work without any modification whereas sizeof(a) / sizeof(int)
would break and need to be updated.
