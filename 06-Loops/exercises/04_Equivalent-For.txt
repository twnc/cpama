Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
(assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?
(a) for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) ...
(b) for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) ...
(c) for (i = 0; i++ < 10; ) ...

(c) is the odd one out. (c) is almost the same. It would give the same results
if the loop body doesn't make any reference to i. But in (c), i is incremented
before the loop body is carried out, whereas in the other two i is incremented
afterwards.
