Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
(assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?
(a) while (i < 10) {...}
(b) for (; i < 10;) {...}
(c) do {...} while (i < 10)

ANSWER: (c) is different to the other two. In most situations they will all have
the same output, but the the do while loop will carry out the loop body at least
once, even if the (i < 10) condition is never met.
