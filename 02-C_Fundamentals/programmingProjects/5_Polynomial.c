// Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x and then displays 
// the value of the following polynomial:
// 3x^5 + 2x^4 - 5x^3 - x^2 + 7x = 6
// Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply
// x by itself repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x. (For example, 
// x * x * x is x cubed.)
