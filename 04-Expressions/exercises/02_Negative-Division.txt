If i and j are positive integers, does (-i)/j always have the same values
as -(i/j)? Justify your answer.

In C99 (-i)/j always has the same values as -(i/j) as any remainder always
truncates towards 0. That way -3/2 would end up rounding towards zero just as
-(3/2) would.

In C89 it is slightly more complicated. In the C89 standard, it is stated
that if either operand is negative, it can be truncated in either direciton.
This makes it somewhat unpredictable as it is implementation defined behaviour.
